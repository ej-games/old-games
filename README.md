# Old Games
Really really old games that I just want to upload so all the cool people can play them.

## How to install
### DISCLAIMER: You will have to download the build folder, not just run the installer.
1. Navigate to the folder that you desire
2. Download the .zip file
3. Extract it anywhere
4. Download the UnityCrashHandler.exe file and UnityPlayer.dll, and add it to the extracted folder
5. Run the main .exe file (should have a unity icon)

#### Enjoy these amazing old terrible games!
